All properties that you need to change marked as `TODO` and checked in workflow to protect you from unexpected titles, paths or something else    
Don't forget to update this readme of course

That's all! Enjoy building your pretty docs site.

# Deployment

This template contains workflows for check on each pull request and deploy when the `main` branch has changed.
Just create pull request to the `main` branch, wait for checks passed, so it will be ready to merge.

# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
